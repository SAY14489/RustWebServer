Scalability:
Collected through wrk tool, output is in scalability.txt.
Thread Count vs Throughput (Requests/sec):

1 thread: 299.80 req/sec
2 threads: 300.67 req/sec
4 threads: 287.33 req/sec
8 threads: 301.81 req/sec
12 threads: 300.32 req/sec

Observations:
Performance isn't scaling with more threads.
There's a bottleneck, possibly with the connection handling.

Improvements: 
Try more robust implementations for taking in new connections through methods such as connection keep-alive.
